We have the daily stock price of this company for the last year (365 daily prices). Some days it increases, some day it decreases. We want to invest in it and maximize our profit. What was the best time to buy (e.g Apr15) and sell (e.g. Sep15) this stock last year? We can buy and sell only once in a year, so don't want to pay too much taxes. \n",
